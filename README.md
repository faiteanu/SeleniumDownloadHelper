SeleniumDownloadHelper
======================

TBW...
It is still WIP but Chrome, Safari, Firefox and PhantomJS are working so far with this method.
HTMLUnit is not working but the why is still open (expected.length=187514 actual.length=176549).
Internet Explorer is untested as I'm currently working on a Mac and this tests will follow later ;-)
